    "# Hide the internal details of the data structure by marking the data members as private (usually using \n",

    "# that can be performed on them, without specifying the internal details.\n",
    "# ADTs provide a clear separation between the interface (functions and operations) and the\n",
    "# implementation (how the data is stored and manipulated).\n",
    "# Examples of ADTs include lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries. Users of these data types \n",
    "# don't need to know how they are implemented, only how to use them.\n",
    "# Information Hiding and Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hide the internal details of a data structure by encapsulating them within a class or module.\n",
    "# Expose a limited and well-defined set of public methods or functions that users can use to interact\n",
    "# with the data structure.\n",
    "# Ensure that the internal state of the data structure cannot be accessed or modified directly from \n",
    "# outside the encapsulating entity, enforcing controlled access.\n",
    "# Data Validation and Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implement data validation checks within the interface methods to ensure that data is used correctly \n",
    "# and consistently.\n",
    "# Handle errors and exceptions gracefully to provide meaningful feedback to users when data manipulation fails due to invalid input or other issues.\n",
    "# Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the data structure, including descriptions of its\n",
    "# purpose, usage, and available methods.\n",
